You start sucking, and when I start sucking, this choke here. 'Cause you can't just have pure fuel, you won't light, you have to have a little bit of oxygen. Geri: Mm-hmm. Michael: It sucks open and it cracks the choke like this. And that's how that works. Geri: That is not what you just said. Michael: I said, no, Geri, the heating is the motherfuckin'… spring! This one here, as soon as you start turnin' over the engine, it's supposed to pull it back when the vacuum starts. When the vacuum starts, nothin' to do with fuckin' heat. Vacuum! Geri: Why are you screaming? Michael: Because the way you said, ""It's supposed to work off heat."" No, Geri! Geri: You said as the car gradually warms up.… Michael: As it gradually warms up, this muthafucker with the coil, the spring opens it up. This has already done it's job, the only thing it's job is to do is when you're cranking the engine up after it's been choked, all it does is pull back, then it cracks open just a pinch. Geri: Then you don't know what it's called. Michael: The Choke Vacuum Diaphragm. Geri: Okay. Michael: I mean, it's right there in the book. Geri: Sure it is. Michael: Oh God. You're a hard, hard woman to live with. Geri: If it was right here in the book, I would've found it. Michael: Oh you muthafucker, you asshole, you stupid son of a bitch, you showed it to me!

It doesn't explain anything. I haven't read anything that explains that. Michael: I told you what it says. Geri: Yeah, you did yes, yesterday. Michael: I just told you what it did. Geri: Mm-hmm? Michael: And you're sittin' there saying you never saw that before, and yet you're the one that fuckin' showed me it, Geri. Geri: You stink like gas. I told you that fuckin' fuel filter was not on there. It's not that fuckin' orange business hanging across the god damn business. Michael: Let's try rebuilding the fuckin' carburetor first, Geri. Let me tell you something, Geri. Let me tell you a little secret, Geri. Geri: Don't tell me any secrets, be quiet! Michael: Oh, man, I quit! I am fed up!
